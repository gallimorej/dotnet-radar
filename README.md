# .NET Tech Radar, Summer 2017

The theme of this radar was that .NET Core is looking more like the clear future for Microsoft for general development, and the 2.0 release may be considered the real version 1.0.

.NET Core in production should be a serious consideration, and a roadmap in how you'll get there should be in place or made soon, with small projects with .NET Core being tested. .NET Core development on MacOS or Linux is a perfectly reasonable possibility.

Visual Studio Code has established itself as a top IDE for a wide range of languages, and Visual Studio 2017 has made some great performance improvements and should be sought if your shop is on VS. ReSharper is still a no-brainer if you're using VS. 

Containers are a main focus at Microsoft now, not just with the new Windows Containers, but the container landscape from .NET Core being able to run in Linux containers, to any app in a container being run in Azure. 

Azure is another main focus, which we should continue to see fast growth.
